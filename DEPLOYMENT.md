## Overview

The deployment process is a two-phase manual workflow:

1. **Build Phase** (`build.sh`) - Run on your development machine
   - Validates environment configuration
   - Builds UI and server code
   - Creates production Docker images
   - Compresses and transfers artifacts to VPS

2. **Deploy Phase** (`deploy.sh`) - Run on the production server
   - Validates environment configuration
   - Backs up current database
   - Extracts build artifacts
   - Loads new Docker images
   - Restarts containers with health checks
   - Verifies successful deployment

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Environment Validation (`validate-env.sh`)
- **What**: Validates all required environment variables before deployment
- **Why**: Prevents deployment failures due to missing or malformed configuration
- **When**: Runs automatically at the start of `build.sh` and `deploy.sh`

### 2. Health Check Polling (in `deploy.sh`)
- **What**: Waits for all containers to become healthy before declaring success
- **Why**: Prevents "deployment succeeded" messages when containers actually failed
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes with status updates every 15 seconds
- **What it checks**: All 4 containers (ui, server, db, redis) must be healthy or running

### 3. Pre-Migration Database Backup (in `server.sh`)
- **What**: Creates a SQL dump backup immediately before running migrations
- **Where**: `data/migration-backups/pre-migration-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql`
- **Why**: Provides a restore point if migrations corrupt data
- **Retention**: Keeps the last 10 backups automatically

### 4. Rollback Script (`rollback.sh`)
- **What**: Automated rollback to a previous version
- **Why**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **What it does**:
  - Creates emergency backup of current state
  - Stops containers
  - Restores database from specified version
  - Loads old Docker images
  - Starts containers with health checks

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- **Git pull failures**: Now exits with error instead of warning
- **Migration failures**: Now exits with error and provides restore instructions
- **Container startup failures**: Now detected and reported

## Prerequisites

### On Development Machine
- Access to production server via SSH
- SSH keys configured (`~/.ssh/id_rsa_{SITE_IP}`)
- `.env-prod` file configured with production settings

### On Production Server
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Nginx reverse proxy running
- Sufficient disk space in `/var/tmp` for backups

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before starting deployment, verify:

```bash
# Run tests
yarn test

# Type check
yarn typecheck

# Verify git status
git status

# Validate environment configuration (optional - runs automatically in build.sh)
./scripts/validate-env.sh .env-prod
```

### Step 2: Build (On Development Machine)

```bash
cd /path/to/NLN
./scripts/build.sh -v 2.2.6 -e .env-prod -d y
```

Arguments:
- `-v`: Version number (updates all package.json files)
- `-e`: Environment file path (defaults to `.env-prod`)
- `-d`: Deploy to VPS (y/N) - if 'y', automatically transfers files

The build script will:
1. ✓ Validate environment configuration
2. ✓ Update version numbers
3. ✓ Build shared packages
4. ✓ Build server
5. ✓ Build UI with production settings
6. ✓ Generate sitemap
7. ✓ Build Docker images
8. ✓ Compress artifacts
9. ✓ Transfer to VPS at `/var/tmp/{VERSION}/`

### Step 3: Deploy (On Production Server)

```bash
cd /srv/app  # or wherever your app is located
./scripts/deploy.sh -v 2.2.6
```

The deploy script will:
1. ✓ Validate environment configuration
2. ✓ Backup current database to `/var/tmp/{VERSION}/postgres`
3. ✓ Extract build artifacts
4. ✓ Pull latest code (scripts, configs)
5. ✓ Run setup.sh
6. ✓ Load Docker images
7. ✓ Stop old containers
8. ✓ Start new containers
9. ✓ **Wait for health checks** (NEW!)
10. ✓ Verify server is responding

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment completes successfully:

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check container logs
docker logs nln_server
docker logs nln_ui

# Verify website is accessible
curl https://newlifenurseryinc.com/
curl https://newlifenurseryinc.com/api/healthcheck

# Check migration backups were created
ls -lh data/migration-backups/
```

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails or you discover issues:

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# On production server
./scripts/rollback.sh -v 2.2.5
```

This will:
1. Create emergency backup of current state
2. Stop current containers
3. Restore database from version 2.2.5 backup
4. Load Docker images from version 2.2.5
5. Start containers
6. Wait for health checks
7. Verify successful rollback

### Manual Rollback (if rollback.sh fails)

1. **Stop containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml down
   ```

2. **Restore database**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf data/postgres
   cp -rp /var/tmp/2.2.5/postgres data/
   ```

3. **Load old images**:
   ```bash
   docker load -i /var/tmp/2.2.5/production-docker-images.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Start containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file /var/tmp/2.2.5/.env-prod -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d
   ```

5. **Monitor startup**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs -f nln_server
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Environment validation failed**
- Check that all required variables are set in `.env-prod`
- Verify URLs start with http:// or https://
- Verify IP addresses are valid
- Run `./scripts/validate-env.sh .env-prod` for details

**Build fails with "yarn build failed"**
- Check for TypeScript errors: `yarn typecheck`
- Check for ESLint errors: `yarn lint`
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `yarn install`

**Docker build fails**
- Check Docker is running: `docker version`
- Check disk space: `df -h`
- Try rebuilding without cache: `docker-compose build --no-cache`

### Deployment Failures

**"Docker images archive not found"**
- Verify build.sh completed successfully
- Check files exist in `/var/tmp/{VERSION}/`
- Re-run build.sh if necessary

**"Timeout waiting for containers to become healthy"**
- Check container logs: `docker logs nln_server`, `docker logs nln_ui`
- Common issues:
  - Database migrations failed
  - Missing environment variables
  - Port conflicts
  - Out of memory

**"Migrations failed"**
- Check migration backup exists: `ls data/migration-backups/`
- Check database logs: `docker logs nln_db`
- Restore from pre-migration backup if needed (instructions printed in error)
- Consider rolling back to previous version

**"Could not pull latest changes from repository"**
- Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
- Check for merge conflicts: `git diff`
- Resolve conflicts and re-run deploy.sh
- Or commit/stash changes before deploying

### Health Check Issues

**Server health check not responding**
- Server may still be initializing (especially after migrations)
- Check server logs: `docker logs nln_server`
- Verify server started: `docker exec nln_server ps aux | grep node`
- Check healthcheck endpoint manually:
  ```bash
  docker exec nln_server curl http://localhost:5331/healthcheck
  ```

**Redis shows "no healthcheck"**
- This is normal for Redis in some configurations
- Verify it's running: `docker exec nln_redis redis-cli ping`

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Still Present

1. **Downtime During Deployment**
   - Containers are stopped before new ones start
   - Typically 2-5 minutes of downtime
   - **Impact**: Users see errors during deployment
   - **Mitigation**: Deploy during low-traffic periods

2. **No Automated Testing Gate**
   - Tests don't run automatically before deployment
   - Must manually run `yarn test` before deploying
   - **Impact**: Broken code can reach production
   - **Mitigation**: Always run tests manually before deploying

3. **Large Transfer Sizes**
   - `node_modules` are transferred (can be 100s of MB)
   - Slow deployments over slow connections
   - **Impact**: Build/deploy takes longer
   - **Mitigation**: Use fast internet connection for builds

4. **No Staging Environment**
   - Production is first place full integration is tested
   - **Impact**: Higher risk of issues in production
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough local testing, manual QA

5. **Manual Version Management**
   - Version must be manually entered and updated
   - **Impact**: Potential for version number mistakes
   - **Mitigation**: Double-check version numbers

## Future Improvements

### High Priority

1. **Zero-Downtime Deployment (Blue-Green)**
   - Run new containers on different ports
   - Switch nginx proxy after health checks pass
   - No user-facing downtime

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing on every commit
   - Automated builds on merge
   - Push images to container registry
   - Optional automated deployment

3. **Stop Transferring node_modules**
   - Install inside Docker build
   - Dramatically faster deployments
   - Already configured in Dockerfiles, just need to update build.sh

### Medium Priority

4. **Proper Docker Image Tagging**
   - Tag with version numbers instead of `:prod`
   - Makes rollback even faster
   - Better tracking of what's running

5. **Separate UI and Server Deployments**
   - Deploy independently
   - Faster, lower-risk updates
   - Hotfix one service without affecting the other

6. **Staging Environment**
   - Test deployments before production
   - Could run on same VPS with different ports

### Lower Priority

7. **Database Migration Safety Tools**
   - Migration validation tests
   - Backward-compatibility checks
   - Tools like Atlas or Bytebase

8. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Automatic alerts on deployment failures
   - Application error tracking
   - Performance monitoring

## Backup Management

### Automatic Backups

**Deployment Backups** (`/var/tmp/{VERSION}/postgres`)
- Created at start of each deployment
- One backup per version
- Manual cleanup (not automatic)

**Migration Backups** (`data/migration-backups/`)
- Created before each migration run
- Keeps last 10 backups automatically
- SQL format (easy to inspect and restore)

**Emergency Backups** (created by rollback.sh)
- Created at `/var/tmp/emergency-backup-{timestamp}/`
- Manual cleanup after verifying rollback worked

### Offsite Backups

Consider setting up the existing `backup.sh` script to run periodically:

```bash
# Run once
./scripts/backup.sh

# Run continuously every 24 hours
./scripts/backup.sh -i 86400 -l y

# Keep last 7 backups
./scripts/backup.sh -c 7
```

This backs up to your development machine for offsite storage.
